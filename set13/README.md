## Description:
TFT Rolling Simulator for set 13. I would really appreciate some kind of feedback or some features, which need to be implemented.

### Installation:
# via exe Download:
1. Go the the Link:     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dlLeCVIRHtuVOSAtMHJdwJp5bEbuN5wm?usp=sharing
   and download dist.rar
3. Go to the Google Drive Link and download all files in a desired folder.
4. To open the Simulator you need to have all folders and files in the same directory. Do not change any names of the files.
# via python:
1. Download the whole folder
2. Go to your folder and open your Command Line
3. Type in:  python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed TFT_set14_rolling_sim.py
4. dist folder will be added into the path
5. Transfer the folder downloaded_images and downloaded_origins into the dist folder. Transfer niki-wichman-elderwoodtft.jpg into dist folder.
6. Run TFT_set14_rolling_sim.exe

### How to use the program:
1. After opening TFT_set13_reroll_sim.exe a window will open.
2. Scroll to your desired Level and Stage (Stage was implemented because of 6.costs, but I did not include them)
3. Enter your desired gold
4. Set the bar to yes, if you would like to have Random Units of each cost remove from the pool to have a more realistic Rolling Simulator
    - The amount of removed units per cost are set depending on the level
    - The numbers are on my personal estimation
5. Start the Simulator
6. Rolling and Fielding Units are the same as in the actual game, key binds are not implemented yet
7. Set your TeamPlaner to highlight Units, you would like to roll for

### Known Problems:

### Improvements:
Key Bind for rolling will be added on E soon
Timer will be added soon!
