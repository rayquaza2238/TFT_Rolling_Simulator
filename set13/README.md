Description:
My first ever project to simulate a TFT Rolling Simulator for set 13. I will constantly add new features and will soon update for set 14. That is why I would really appreciate some kind of feedback or some features, which need to be implemented.

Installation:
1. Go to the Google Drive Link and download all files in a desired folder.
2. To open the Simulator you need to have all folders and files in the same directory. Do not change any names of the files.


How to use the program:
1. After opening TFT_set13_reroll_sim.exe a window will open.
2. Scroll to your desired Level and Stage (Stage was implemented because of 6.costs, but I did not include them)
3. Enter your desired gold
4. Set the bar to yes, if you would like to have Random Units of each cost remove from the pool to have a more realistic Rolling Simulator
    - The amount of removed units per cost are set depending on the level
    - The numbers are on my personal estimation
5. Start the Simulator
6. Rolling and Fielding Units are the same as in the actual game, key binds are not implemented yet
7. Set your TeamPlaner to highlight Units, you would like to roll for

Known Problems:

Improvements:
Set 14 will be added soon!
Key Bind for rolling will be added on E soon
Timer will be added soon!
